Skylar: Hey!
Theo (Surprised): Dalton!
Theo (Concerned): Why do you have that in your pocket?!
Dalton (Squint): It’s not dangerous if it’s wrapped.
Theo (Surprised): Still you seem surprisingly chill about this!

Dalton (Talk): I found this while looking around Quincy’s bar.
Theo (Surprised): What!
Theo (Resting): And you didn’t think to tell me?

Skylar (Awkward): ...
Skylar (Default): Could we get food first?
Skylar (Happy1): I haven’t had a proper meal in months.
