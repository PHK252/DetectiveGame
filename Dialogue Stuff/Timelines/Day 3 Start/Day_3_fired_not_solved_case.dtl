Dalton (Angry): What is this?
Dalton: I failed to solve one case, and now you fire me!
Chief: [shake rate=10.0 level=4 connected=2]Detective Reynard, you and I both know that this was a long time coming.[/shake]

Chief: [shake rate=10.0 level=4 connected=2]Look...[/shake]
Chief: [shake rate=10.0 level=4 connected=2]I kept you on paperwork for a year now in hopes you would get over what happened to Isaac.[/shake]
Chief: [shake rate=10.0 level=4 connected=2]But I can’t justify keeping you around anymore when I can easily hire an intern to do your job.[/shake]
Chief: [shake rate=10.0 level=4 connected=2]I put you on this case to see if you were ready to get back out there...[/shake]

Chief: [shake rate=10.0 level=4 connected=2]Look.[/shake] 
Chief: [shake rate=10.0 level=4 connected=2]This wasn’t by any means an easy decision.[/shake]
